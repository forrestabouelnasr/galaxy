# galaxy simulator

This code will simulate a galaxy of stars interacting gravitationally

TO DO:
(1) add "Particle - In - Cell" (PIC) functionality or similar
	Reduce the number of two-body interaction calculations from O(N^2).
(2) add variable time-step algorithms. the "dt" might vary over time and/or between objects
(3) add perspective 3D imagery. See:
